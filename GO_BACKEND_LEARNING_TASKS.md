# Go Backend Learning Tasks for Real-time Chat App

## **Phase 1: Foundation & Understanding**

- **Task 1**: Set up the Go development environment and understand basic Go syntax
- **Task 2**: Study the existing `main.go` and `go.mod` files to understand the current structure
- **Task 3**: Learn about Go modules, packages, and basic HTTP handling

## **Phase 2: Basic HTTP Server**

- **Task 1**: Create a simple HTTP server that can handle basic routes
- **Task 2**: Implement basic endpoints (health check, status)
- **Task 3**: Add basic middleware (logging, CORS)

## **Phase 3: WebSocket Basics**

- **Task 1**: Learn about WebSocket protocol and Go's `gorilla/websocket` package
- **Task 2**: Implement a basic WebSocket connection handler
- **Task 3**: Create a simple echo server that sends back received messages

## **Phase 4: Chat Room Structure**

- **Task 1**: Design and implement basic data structures for chat rooms and messages
- **Task 2**: Create a simple in-memory storage system for rooms
- **Task 3**: Implement room creation and joining functionality

## **Phase 5: Real-time Messaging**

- **Task 1**: Implement message broadcasting to all users in a room
- **Task 2**: Add user connection management (connect/disconnect handling)
- **Task 3**: Handle different message types (text, join/leave notifications)

## **Phase 6: Polish & Testing**

- **Task 1**: Add error handling and edge cases
- **Task 2**: Implement basic testing
- **Task 3**: Add configuration management

## **Learning Resources to Provide**

- Go official tutorial and tour
- WebSocket protocol explanation
- Real-time chat architecture patterns
- Go concurrency patterns (goroutines, channels)

## **Task Assignment Strategy**

- Start with very small, achievable tasks
- Provide code examples for similar patterns
- Use pair programming for complex concepts
- Have regular check-ins to discuss challenges
- Encourage questions and experimentation

## **Key Concepts to Master**

- Go syntax and basic programming concepts
- HTTP server implementation
- WebSocket protocol and implementation
- Concurrency with goroutines and channels
- Data structure design
- Error handling patterns
- Testing in Go

## **Success Criteria for Each Phase**

- Code compiles without errors
- Basic functionality works as expected
- Understanding of the concepts implemented
- Ability to explain the code written
- Ready to move to the next phase

The key is to break down the real-time chat functionality into digestible pieces that build upon each other, allowing your teammate to understand each concept before moving to the next one.
